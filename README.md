# Skin-Lesions-Detection
This project presents a deep learning model designed to accurately detect various skin conditions, including Mpox, Chickenpox, Measles, Cowpox, Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease, and healthy skin. Leveraging a diverse dataset and the power of transfer learning with MobileNet-V2, the model achieves high sensitivity (99.43%) and specificity (99.91%) in identifying skin lesions.
